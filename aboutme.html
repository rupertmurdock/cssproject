            <h2>Hello, my name is Robin Dunne. I recently moved to Fullerton to be closer to the school I'm attending, CSUF. It is my first semester here after transferring from OCC and so far I am very happy with my decision to come here.</h2>
            <h2>I love Computer Science and am having fun expanding my knowledge in an array of CS-related topics including Software Engineering, Web Development, Operating Systems, more specific PL, and how the ins and outs of computers work in totality.</h2>
